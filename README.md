# Football: A Game of Chants

## Introduction and Background

## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories

As a football fan, I want to:

1. Discover the title and lyrics of chants/songs from various football clubs
2. Share football chants with other fans around the world
3. Update chants with latest lyrics or chorus changes
4. Delete chants when they are created in error or become irrelevant

As a site owner, I want:

1. A page containing all chants submitted by users with an option to view lyrics
2. A quick and easy method for fans to upload chants
3. A record linking each chant created to a user
4. A simple method for users to register with

### Wireframes

I used the [Balsamiq] tool to create low-fi prototypes of how the site pages would look. 
This gave a good starting guide as to how various features might appear to the user. Not every feature was 
maintained from the orginal wireframes, such as Search which was deemed not to have sufficient value for the user.
